# Qt-OpenGL-Demos
I follow LearnOpenGL[!https://learnopengl.com/], and write these code.

# Why Qt?
Thanks to QtWidget, it is possible to focus more on the openGL itself rather than create window and solve various widget events.


# Warning
These code is just for study. There may be some unsuitable code style, or nonstandard code such as didn't delete the pointer in destructor. So, pay attention to it.
